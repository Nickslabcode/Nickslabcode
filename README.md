### üå± Junior JavaScript Developer

A hands-on learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding.   

I graduated from Telerik Academy's Alpha JavaScript track, where I spent 6 months learning JavaScript and web development. Recognized for my dedication, discipline, and helpfulness to colleagues, I was offered a mentor role in the academy twice.
