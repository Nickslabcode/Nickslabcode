## 👋 Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### 🎯 Aspiring JavaScript Developer | Former Support Specialist

I'm a lifelong learner who's recently transitioned from support to coding. Recently completing Telerik Academy’s JavaScript track, I’ve spent the last 6 months diving into Javascript and web development, and I’m excited to grow even more. With a passion for problem-solving and building user-friendly applications, I’m eager to bring my enthusiasm and dedication to a junior developer role.


### 🚀 What I'm Working On:
- **JavaScript & React Development:** Still early in my journey, but I’m already building dynamic web applications, with a drive to constantly improve.
- **Learning by Doing:** I’m hands-on with projects, experimenting with new frameworks and best practices to expand my skillset.
- **Collaboration:** Coming from customer support, I know the value of teamwork, I have applied it in my [3 biggest projects](https://github.com/yourusername?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) so far and I'm eager to apply it in tech teams while continuing to learn from others.
