## 👋 Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### 🌱 Junior JavaScript Developer

I'm a lifelong learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding. Recently completing Telerik Academy’s JavaScript track, I’ve spent the last 6 months diving into Javascript and web development, and I’m excited to grow even more.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **JavaScript & React Development**: Actively building dynamic web applications with a focus on React and core JavaScript fundamentals, while continuously enhancing my skills and best practices.
- **NestJS Exploration**: Currently expanding my backend knowledge by diving into NestJS, developing a deeper understanding of scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

**💻 Stay tuned for my next big project**: A full-stack SPA with React, NestJS with TypeORM for backend, and PostGreSQL.
