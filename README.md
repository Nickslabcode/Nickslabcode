## Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### üå± Junior Software Engineer @ interop.io ‚Ä¢ Junior JavaScript Developer

A hands-on learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding.   

I completed the Alpha JavaScript track at Telerik Academy, dedicating six months to building a solid foundation for JavaScript and web development. Due to my commitment, discipline, and supportiveness towards my peers, I was honored with a mentor role at the academy.
