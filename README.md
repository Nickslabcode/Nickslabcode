## Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### üå± Junior JavaScript Developer

A hands-on learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding.   

I graduated from Telerik Academy, completing the Alpha JavaScript track, where I spent 6 months learning JavaScript and web development and 2 months afterward mentoring a group of 3 students with their own final react project.

Check my portfolio [here](https://nikola-nenovski.info).

### üöÄ What I'm Working On

- **JavaScript & React**: Actively practicing React and core JavaScript fundamentals, while continuously enhancing my skills and best practices.
- **NestJS Exploration**: Recently expanded my backend knowledge by diving into NestJS & TypeORM, developing a deeper understanding of scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

### **Current project**: 
Full-stack Domain info lookup SPA for displaying WhoIS, DNS and SSL information in one place, as well as extra info such as CDN and WordPress instance checks. 
Stack:
  - **Front-end:** React, TypeScript, Axios, HttpYac, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
  - **Proxy:** Cloudflare worker with TypeScript.
  - **Back-end (separate private repo):** Express, AWS lambda.

Check the project repo **[here](https://github.com/Nickslabcode/domain-info-lookup)**.


**üíª Next Project**: A full-stack SPA with React, TypeScript, NestJS with TypeORM for backend, and PostGreSQL. More details TBA.
