### 🎯 Aspiring JavaScript Developer

I'm a lifelong learner who's recently transitioned from support to coding. Recently completing Telerik Academy’s JavaScript track, I’ve spent the last 6 months diving into Javascript and web development, and I’m excited to grow even more.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On:
- **JavaScript & React Development:** Still early in my journey, but I’m already building dynamic web applications, with a drive to constantly improve.
- **Learning by Doing:** I’m hands-on with projects, experimenting with new frameworks and best practices to expand my skillset.
