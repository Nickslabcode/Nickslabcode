## Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### üå± Junior JavaScript Developer

I'm a lifelong, hands-on learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding. Recently completing Telerik Academy‚Äôs JavaScript track, I‚Äôve spent the last 6 months diving into JavaScript and web development, and I‚Äôm excited to grow even more.

### üöÄ What I'm Working On

- **JavaScript & React**: Actively practicing React and core JavaScript fundamentals, while continuously enhancing my skills and best practices.
- **NestJS Exploration**: Currently expanding my backend knowledge by diving into NestJS & TypeORM, developing a deeper understanding of scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

**Current project**: Working on the front-end for a domain info lookup tool for displaying WhoIS, DNS and SSL information in one place. Using React, TypeScript, Axios, HttpYac, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI and you can check it <a href="https://github.com/Nickslabcode/domain-info-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

**üíª Next Project**: A full-stack SPA with React, TypeScript, NestJS with TypeORM for backend, and PostGreSQL. More details TBA.
