## Hi, I'm Nick, short for Nikola

### üå± Junior JavaScript Developer

A hands-on learner who's recently transitioned from tech support to coding.   

I graduated from Telerik Academy, completing the Alpha JavaScript track, where I spent 6 months learning JavaScript and web development and 2 months afterward mentoring a group of 3 students with their own final react project.

Check my portfolio **[here](https://nikola-nenovski.info)**.

### üöÄ What I'm Working On

- **JavaScript & React**: Actively practicing React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, continuously learning best practices, good coding habits, and writing clean code.
- **GOLANG Exploration**: Recently embarked on learning the fundamentals of Go to enhance my back-end development skills

  ### **Current project**: 
  Full-stack Domain info lookup SPA for displaying WhoIS, DNS and SSL information in one place, as well as extra info such as CDN and WordPress instance checks. 
  Check the project repo **[here](https://github.com/Nickslabcode/domain-info-lookup)**.  
  
  **üíª Next Project**: A full-stack multiplayer game with real-time updates. The backend will be built with Go and WebSockets for real-time communication, while the frontend will use React and TypeScript. GORM and PostgreSQL will handle database interactions. More details TBA!
